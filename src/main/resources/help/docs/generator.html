  <li>The length of the password.</li>

  <li>If you select "readable" &nbsp;passwords, only characters a-z
will be used. This is less safe, but it is easier to remember the
passwords. It depends which level of security you want. </li>

  <li>Upper/lower case will be used if selected.</li>

  <li>Digits will be used if selected.</li>

  <li>Punctuation will be used if selected. Not all applications support such passwords.</li>

  <li>The category gives an indication of the safety level of the generated passwords. This is only indicative.</li>

</ol>
The more "unreadable" you make the passwords the safer they are, but the trade-off is that they are difficult to remember.
