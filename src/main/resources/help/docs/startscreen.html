<h1>
Start Screen</h1>


<img style="width: 678px; height: 236px;" alt="Password Tracker start screen." src="../assets/ss-1.jpg"><br>


The start screen has two main functions:<br>


<ol>


  <li>Create new safe files.</li>


  <li>Open existing safe files.</li>


</ol>


If this is the first time you start the application, you can also have
a look at the <a href="quickstart.html">Quick start</a>
page. It explains in detail how to create a new password safe.
<h2>Create new safe files<br>


</h2>


<ol>


  <li>Enter the path of a new safe (text box 1). The filename
should not exist. If
&nbsp;there already is a file with the same name, Password Tracker
will
try to open it, so you first have to remove or rename the existing
file. Note: if you do not add an extension, the application will assume
a ".dat" extension. This behavior can be modified in the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>. You can use
the browse button to interactively select a file and its location
(button 2).</li>


  <li>Enter the pass phrase of the new safe (text box 3). </li>


  <li>Click the "Go" button (button 4).</li>


</ol>


You can always abort the application by clicking button 5 "Cancel".
Clicking the "Help" button (button 6) will start the on line help system.
<br>


The application will ask a confirmation that it is your intention to
create a new safe. If you confirm this, a new empty safe will be
created. You will be redirected to the <a href="mainscreen.html">main
screen</a> You can start adding new entries and save your data. <br>


<h2>
Open existing safe files<br>


</h2>


<ol>


  <li>Enter the path of an existing safe (text box 1). The file
should exist. Note: if you do not add an extension, the application
will assume a
".dat" extension. This behavior can be modified in the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.&nbsp;You
can use the browse button to interactively select a file and its
location (button 2).</li>


  <li>Enter the pass phrase to unlock the file (text box 3)</li>


  <li>Click the Go button.</li>


</ol>


<br>


The application will start unlocking the file using the pass phrase. You
will be redirected to the <a href="mainscreen.html">main
screen</a>.
