<h2>Warning<br>


</h2>



Password Tracker lets you import/export your passwords to general
accepted text formats in order to assure you that your data is not
locked in a propriety format. Comma Separated Values (CSV) and Extended
Markup Language are supported. Note that exporting your data to one of
these formats is inherently dangerous, your passwords become
unprotected. You should do this with care, don't let the exported data
linger around.<br>


<h2>
Importing data<br>



</h2>


<ul>



  <li>Existing safe</li>



  <li>CSV</li>



  <li>XML<br>


  </li>



</ul>

<h2>
Exporting data<br>



</h2>


<ul>



  <li>CSV</li>



  <li>XML</li>



</ul>


As you might have noticed, the export menu does not contain the normal
password safe format. This is because you an always do a "save as".
This has the same functionality.
